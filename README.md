On the notebook is all the code we used to get 92% MAPE on the validation test

The majority of the comments is in french a translated version isn't yet our priority. 

We used data and features engineering
  -Random forest was our first method we reached 93% MAPE 
  -We used a CNN (2.8M parameters) to reach 92% MAPE

The fisrt in this data set has reached 64% MAPE, we are not currently working on improving our score

We hope this notebook will help you in any sort of way. 

The data is in the .zip
The packages necesserary are : numpy, matplotlib, keras, tensorflow and others
